The solution might involve updating the `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` file.  If the original `minSdkVersion` is 21, try increasing it to 24 or higher to resolve conflicts. Always consult the Expo documentation and Android build tools documentation for the most appropriate value.  Additionally, updating dependencies can resolve the issue. The files provided are examples; adaptation based on your project's specific requirements might be necessary. For example:

Original `build.gradle` (bug.gradle):
```gradle
android {
    compileSdkVersion 33
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "your.app.id"
        minSdkVersion 21 // Problem may arise here
        targetSdkVersion 33
    }
}
```
Modified `build.gradle` (build.gradle.solution):
```gradle
android {
    compileSdkVersion 33
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "your.app.id"
        minSdkVersion 24 // Increased to resolve the potential issue
        targetSdkVersion 33
    }
}
```
