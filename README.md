# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: minSdkVersion Issue in build.gradle

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Android APKs using the Expo CLI. The error stems from inconsistencies in the `android/app/build.gradle` file concerning the `minSdkVersion`. The main challenge is the lack of precise error messaging from the Expo CLI, making debugging difficult.

## Problem

The typical error scenario involves vague messages suggesting a problem in the build process, often related to the `minSdkVersion` setting.  This is frustrating because the actual cause may not be directly obvious within the error log.

## Solution

The solution usually involves checking and adjusting several aspects:

1. **Update Dependencies:** Ensure your Expo SDK, React Native, and Android build tools are up-to-date. Outdated components can lead to compatibility conflicts.
2. **Adjust minSdkVersion:**  Try modifying the `minSdkVersion` setting in `android/app/build.gradle`. Carefully consider the trade-off between supporting older devices and utilizing newer features.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:**  A simple clean and rebuild of the project may resolve temporary inconsistencies.
4. **Examine Gradle Files:**  Thoroughly review the `build.gradle` files for any syntactical errors, misconfigurations, or compatibility problems.
5. **Revert SDK Versions:** As a last resort, consider reverting to older, stable versions of the Expo SDK if newer versions introduce incompatibility issues.
